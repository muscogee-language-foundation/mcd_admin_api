# Muscogee (Creek) Dictionary Admin API

This is the API for the Muscogee (Creek) Dictionary Admin. We have already collected over 10K words mostly from the book [English and Muskokee Dictionary by Robert McGill Loughridge, David M. Hodge](https://archive.org/details/englishandmusko00unkngoog/page/n7). We want to continue to add to this collection and make it available to those interested in learning the Muscogee (Creek) Language.

What needs to be done right now is updating the words and definitions. Some words are incorrect or are poorly written. Some definitions don't make any sense. There is quite a bit of clean up to do.

A companion client is in the works in another repository. A link will be shared here once that repository is live.
